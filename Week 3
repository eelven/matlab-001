3.1 Introduction to Functions (5:39)

The built-in function named rand, creates random numbers between 0 and 1
The numbers are uniformly distributed and that means that any number in
that range is equally likely to be chosen. Here's an example of how we
might call it.
Creates a 3x4 matrix of random numbers between 0 and 1
>> rand(3,4)

ans =

    0.8147    0.9134    0.2785    0.9649
    0.9058    0.6324    0.5469    0.1576
    0.1270    0.0975    0.9575    0.9706

>>
What if we needed radom numbers between one and ten instead?
 1+rand(3,4)*9
(multiply them by 9, stretch the range to go from 0 to 9 and adding 1
shifts the range to go from 1 to 10)
ans =

    7.2535    1.3100    7.8897    5.4079
    3.8539    4.9487    8.1568    5.0103
    9.5520    4.4340    2.6819    6.8168

So, let's create our own function that does what we want it to do,
then we can just call that function repeatedly. Let's call it myRand.
We create a function by using the Editor. We can get it with the 
command Edit and the editor window.
>> edit
The Editor is the place that you type in code that you can save in a
file and the code we're going to type into the Editor will be a function.
>> edit
function myRand
a = 1+rand(3,4)*9
end
And I'm going to put an optional end in here. Notice that function and
end both turn blue. These are key works. The word myRand is of course
the name of our function. Now we want to be able to run this function
and in order to run the function we have to save it into a file.
MATLAB reminds us that we haven't yet saved it in a file with this little
word untitled and this little asterisk right . To save our function into
its file, we click in Save ribbon and save myRand.m (all MATLAB must be
stored in files with the extension dot m)
The file is saved right in current folder, that's exactly where we want
it to be, because that's where MATLAB look for it when we tell it to run it.
We've opened the Editor, we've typed in a function, we've saved it into
a file. We can now run it by typing its name in the command window, just
like we would for a built-in function. Let's do it:
>> myRand

a =

    7.7614    7.2917    5.9249    3.3176
    3.2959    9.0181    2.2476    8.5665
    5.5536    9.6336    2.3436    3.2885
